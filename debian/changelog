phosh-mobile-settings (0.23.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  * main: Use SPDX-License-Identifier
  * application: Fix parent class
  * build: Avoid deprecated get_pkgconfig_variable
  * build: Bump glib dependency to 2.66
  * README: Use meson consistently
  * build: Use meson's version_compare.
    This avoids a warning as meson now knows we're excluding
    code base on it's version
  * build: Depend on phosh-plugins
  * plugin-panel: Fix typo
  * lockscreen-panel: Fix typo
  * lockscreen-panel: Allow plugins to have preferences
  * build: Make phosh-dev dependency optional for the moment.
    This allows us to build until phosh-dev ends up in distros.

  * l5-panel: Don't forget to bind the suspend button.
    Otherwise we can't make it (un)sensitive
  * window: Don't forward to welcome page.
    This createes unneeded flicker and adds one additional tap
    every use to go back to the panel.
  * window: Move device panel addition to constructed.
    As pointed out by exalm doing this in realize is a bad idea.
    We had it there as we wanted to access GApplication but that wasn't set
    as prop yet but we can simply use g_application_get_default()
  * main: Use G_APPLICATION_DEFAULT_FLAGS to avoid depreation warning.
    Provide a fallback for older glib until we can enforce 2.74.
  * build: Add and use app id
  * app: Use AdwAboutDialog.
    In contrast to GtkAboutDialog it's adaptive and fits phone screens.
    For that we need to bump the adwaita dependency to 1.2.
  * l5-panel: Don't forget to bind the suspend button.
    Otherwise we can't make it (un)sensitive
  * window: Don't forward to welcome page.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * ms-convergence-panel: Explain how to fetch the values for adding new docks
  * Revert "lockscreen-panel: Mark additional widgets as experimental"
    This currently makes the window overflow (although it should be word
    wrapped)

  [ Kyle Rankin ]
  * Add support for UPERFECT X Mini lapdock.
    This adds convergence panel support for the UPERFECT X Mini lapdock:

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * ci: Use newer Debian Bookworm image.
    This lets the builds pass again.
  * build: Plugin uses gio bits.
    Add a proper dependency
  * data: Update the appstream release information
  * Move plugins to phosh-mobile-settings/ folder
  * Allow to enable and disable lockscreen plugins (Closes: #12)
  * lockscreen-panel: Use plugin info.
    Don't just rely on the plugin path but rather parse the available
    information so we can have translated descriptions, etc.
  * lockscreen-panel: Don't try to read from inexistent dir
  * lockscreen-panel: Mark additional widgets as experimental

  [ Sebastian Krzyszkowiak ]
  * librem5-plugin: Adjust sensor mappings for temperatures.
    On the Librem 5, bq25890_charger driver reports the temperature
    as monitored by the thermisor inside the battery, while the
    max170xx_battery driver reports the internal temperature of
    the fuel gauge chip. Adjust sensor descriptions to match that.
