phosh-mobile-settings (0.21.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * ci: Use newer Debian Bookworm image.
    This lets the builds pass again.
  * build: Plugin uses gio bits.
    Add a proper dependency
  * data: Update the appstream release information
  * Move plugins to phosh-mobile-settings/ folder
  * Allow to enable and disable lockscreen plugins (Closes: #12)
  * lockscreen-panel: Use plugin info.
    Don't just rely on the plugin path but rather parse the available
    information so we can have translated descriptions, etc.
  * lockscreen-panel: Don't try to read from inexistent dir
  * lockscreen-panel: Mark additional widgets as experimental

  [ Sebastian Krzyszkowiak ]
  * librem5-plugin: Adjust sensor mappings for temperatures.
    On the Librem 5, bq25890_charger driver reports the temperature
    as monitored by the thermisor inside the battery, while the
    max170xx_battery driver reports the internal temperature of
    the fuel gauge chip. Adjust sensor descriptions to match that.
